## âœ¨ Modifications in This Version

* **Simplified DLL Naming:**
    The core file has been renamed from `veritas.dll` to **`xluau.dll`**. This is to make the process of copying the file for injection easier and more convenient.

* **Improved Battle Mode Detection:**
    The logic for detecting battle modes has been enhanced for greater accuracy, please copy `battle_modes.json` to your game installation folder.

* **ðŸ“ˆ Automatic Battle Analysis (JSON Summaries & Analyzer Script)**
    This version introduces a powerful workflow for analyzing your battle performance.

    **Step 1: Automatic Data Generation**
    The tool automatically generates a detailed **JSON summary** for each battle session. These files contain rich data about your team's performance.
    * **Location:** The summaries are saved in a `battle_summaries` folder, which is created inside the game's client directory (the same location as the game's `.exe` file).

    **Step 2: Visualize and Compare with `analyzer.py`**
    Included in this project is an `analyzer.py` script, a tool to parse, visualize, and compare the data from your battle summaries.

    To use it, follow these instructions:

    1.  **Find your data:** Navigate to your game installation folder and locate the `battle_summaries` directory.
    2.  **Copy the folder:** Copy the entire `battle_summaries` folder and paste it into the same directory where the `analyzer.py` script is located.
    3.  **Install dependencies:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the script's directory and run:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    4.  **Run the analyzer:** Once the dependencies are installed, run the script with:
        ```bash
        python analyzer.py
        ```
    A graphical window will open, displaying charts and comparisons of your battle sessions.
